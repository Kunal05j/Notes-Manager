Notes Manager

## Objective
Create a simple text-based notes manager using Java that can write and read notes from a file.

## Tools
- Java
- intellij
- Terminal

## How It Works
1. The program allows the user to:
   - Write a note (saved to `C:/Users/kunal/OneDrive/Documents/intelljProperties.Resume.txt`)
   - Read all saved notes
   - Exit the application
2. Notes are stored using `FileWriter` and read using `FileReader`/`BufferedReader`.
